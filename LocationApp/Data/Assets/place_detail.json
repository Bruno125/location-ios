So they come to our country want a presence, won't take responsibility for their works, want us to treat them fairly etc, off hand taking care of our businesses to some English as a second language speaking people, and thinks that will be enough.

There is no thought behind how the whole business review process works and the only answer you get from support staff is that they are only trained to direct people to the Google support page. Why do you need people at the end of a phone line to tell you that?\n\nAs it stands, there is nothing stopping me from standing in front of a store and giving a negative review to a business based on whether it was raining that day or not. There is no process here to verify if the claim of the user is right or not. I thought the whole process of reviews were meant to be a fair representation of the service the business provides. Where is the fairness here?\n\nGoogle encourages businesses to respond to people's reviews. Is Google responding to the reviews that are posted about their business? Why the double standards Google?",
